# Lifecycle methods and hooks

This is a template repo for  use in demoes to show the  setupand use of useState, useEffect and useContext APIs in React 18

## Setup for use in lectures
Some basic bootstrapping has been done to give a clean starting point. 
- Clone the repo then checkout commit titled 'Add child and grandchild components for use with useContext', create a new branch, then complete your demo (committing as you go).
- Once the demo is complete, create a new github repo (including the cohorts name in the title), and add it as a new remote.
- Push up your changes to this remote so students have a copy of the exact code being written in the demo
